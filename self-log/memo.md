OTA Monitoring Automation Solution:

Executive Summary:
Kasa's manual spreadsheet monitoring can't scale with hundreds of listings, causing revenue-impacting issues to go undetected for days. I designed a hierarchical monitoring system using n8n that automatically detects anomalies across all properties, enabling teams to respond before revenue is lost.

Methodology & Assumptions:
- Focused on conversion rate anomalies as highest-impact metric
- Assumed API/webhook access to OTA performance data
- Designed for current scale (hundreds of properties) with growth capacity
- Prioritized actionable alerts over data overload

The Why - Technology Selection:

Core Orchestration Platform:
- Zapier: User-friendly but charges per task ($600+/month for hundreds of properties)
- Make: Good but limited Python support for anomaly detection
- n8n (Selected): Scales cost-effectively with self-hosting, unlimited executions at fixed server cost, supports custom code for complex logic. Leverages my experience with production automation systems (6,073 records processed via orchestrated pipelines, Slack integration for real-time alerts)

Data Enrichment Tools Evaluated:
- Apollo/Clay/Clearbit: Designed for lead enrichment, not OTA monitoring. Could enhance Phase 2 for competitor intelligence
- Google Maps API: Useful for location-based insights (e.g., nearby events affecting demand). Planned for Phase 2 predictive features
- Current focus: Monitor existing OTA metrics before adding external data sources

Why n8n scales best:
- 100 properties = $50/month server
- 1,000 properties = $50/month server (same cost!)
- 10,000 properties = $200/month server (vs $6,000+/month on Zapier)

The How - Alert Delivery:
Alerts route to Slack channels organized by team and severity:
- #revenue-critical: Conversion drops >40%, missing pricing (@ mentions)
- #distribution-high: Listing downtime, missing amenities
- #ops-medium: Minor anomalies, optimization opportunities

Each alert includes: specific issue, revenue impact, direct OTA extranet link, and recommended action.

Error Handling:
- API Failures: Cached data fallback with confidence scores, escalating alerts if >2hr downtime
- Missing Data: Partial analysis continues, flags incomplete metrics in alerts
- False Positives: Feedback buttons in Slack to tune sensitivity per property

The "And Then What" - Insights to Action:
Revenue Team Actions:
- Pricing alerts → Direct link to rate adjustment page
- Conversion drops → Competitor analysis included
- Booking velocity changes → Seasonal pattern context

Distribution Team Actions:
- Listing down → Pre-filled support ticket
- Missing content → Specific fields highlighted
- Policy errors → Compliance checklist provided

Next Steps & Questions:
1. Pilot with 10 high-revenue properties to establish baselines
2. Integrate existing spreadsheet historical data
3. Key questions for implementation:
   - Current OTA API access levels?
   - Preferred alert frequency and quiet hours?
   - Existing property categorization for peer comparison?
4. Future enhancements: Predictive alerts, competitive monitoring, auto-remediation for simple issues

This POC demonstrates Phase 1 capabilities focused on core OTA monitoring. Based on initial results and team feedback, we can prioritize Phase 2 enhancements such as competitor intelligence (Apollo/Clay integration), location-based demand prediction (Google Maps API), or advanced ML-driven forecasting. This phased approach ensures continuous value delivery while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on real-world performance and evolving business needs.
