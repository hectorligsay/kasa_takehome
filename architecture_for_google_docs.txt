The 3-Stage Analysis Framework

Stage 1: First Impressions (What Gets Clicks)

• GPT-4 Vision: Photo appeal scoring
• Test 3 personas via GPT-4: budget-conscious, family vacation, luxury seeker
• Title optimization for search keywords
• Price positioning vs competitors

Stage 2: Conversion Factors (What Drives Bookings)

• Description readability and persuasiveness
• Review sentiment analysis
• Amenity competitiveness scoring

Stage 3: Backend Validation

• Occupancy rate vs market average (AirDNA)
• Booking velocity comparison
• Google Trends: Seasonal validation
• Weighted Scoring: Photos (30%), Pricing (25%), Reviews (20%), Description (15%), Amenities (10%)

Error Handling (3-Layer Failover)

1. Data Collection: Webhook → API polling → Web scraping
2. Analysis: GPT-4 → Rule-based scoring → Cached data (7-day max)
3. Delivery: Slack → n8n retry queue → Email digest backup

Never skip alerts due to partial data - flag as "Limited Analysis" and proceed.

Data Sources Explained

• Internal Data: Your actual performance metrics
• AirDNA API: Market occupancy, ADR, RevPAR ($500/month)
• Google Trends: Demand forecasting (free)
• Public Listings: Competitor analysis via ethical scraping

Cost Structure

• n8n hosting: $50/month (unlimited executions)
• AirDNA API: $500/month (market intelligence)
• GPT-4 Vision: ~$180/month (100 properties daily)
• Total: ~$730/month for complete intelligence

What makes this a great solution?

1. Scales efficiently: Same architecture works for 10 or 1000 properties
2. Cost-effective: Fixed $730/month vs $6000+ for Zapier at scale
3. Intelligent insights: Not just "what's wrong" but "why" and "how to fix"
4. Market context: Performance relative to competitors, not absolute thresholds
5. Actionable alerts: Specific fixes with expected ROI, not generic warnings
6. ROI: 1.5-4x return on investment through revenue protection
