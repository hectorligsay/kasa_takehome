# Day 3 Log - Wednesday, August 20, 2025

## 2:15 PM - Starting Implementation

After 2 days of planning and documentation, we're finally building. Time remaining: ~34 hours.

### Current Status:
-  All documentation complete
-  Memo drafted
-  Architecture designed
- =§ Setting up n8n account
- ó Need to build POC
- ó Need to create Mermaid diagram

### Decision Log:
- Using n8n cloud free trial for quick start
- Will adapt production components from previous projects:
  - Slack integration from camila-app
  - Checkpoint system patterns from werkflow
  - Performance monitoring concepts from mcp_server

### Next 2 Hours Plan:
1. n8n account setup
2. Create mock CSV data
3. Build basic workflow
4. Test anomaly detection

### Why JavaScript instead of TypeScript:
- n8n's Function nodes use JavaScript by default
- Faster iteration for POC (no build step)
- Can show TS knowledge in other components
- Time constraint - need working demo TODAY

### Files to Include in Final Submission:
- `/prompts/master.md` - Project overview
- `/self-log/memo.md` - Required deliverable
- Architecture diagram (PNG from Mermaid)
- n8n workflow export
- Demo video/screenshots
- Sample data and results

### Components Being Integrated:
From previous projects:
- Slack webhook formatting (camila-app)
- Quality scoring logic adapted for anomaly detection (werkflow)
- Performance tracking patterns (mcp_server)

Time to build!
