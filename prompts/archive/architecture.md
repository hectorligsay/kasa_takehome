## Alert Scoring Logic

### Revenue Impact Score (0-100)
```
Revenue Impact = (Baseline Revenue - Current Revenue) × Days Until Resolution
```

### Urgency Factors
1. **Revenue Loss Rate** (40% weight)
   - Dollar amount lost per day
2. **Trend Direction** (30% weight)
   - Accelerating vs stabilizing issue
3. **Market Conditions** (20% weight)
   - High season vs low season
4. **Property Priority** (10% weight)
   - High-value vs standard properties

### Alert Categories

#### Critical (Score 80-100)
- Complete listing downtime
- >50% conversion drop
- Missing pricing/availability
- Immediate revenue impact >$500/day

#### High (Score 60-79)
- 25-50% performance drop
- Missing key amenities/fees
- Ranking drop >10 positions
- Revenue impact $100-500/day

#### Medium (Score 40-59)
- 10-25% performance drop
- Suboptimal rate plans
- Minor policy issues
- Revenue impact $50-100/day

#### Low (Score 0-39)
- <10% performance variance
- Optimization opportunities
- Informational alerts
