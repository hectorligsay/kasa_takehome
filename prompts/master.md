   - Track metrics: time saved, error reduction, team productivity
   - Clear ROI calculations for every initiative
   - Focus on helping teams work on higher-value activities

**Technical Proficiency Stack:**
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, JavaScript for automation
- **Orchestration**: n8n, Zapier, Make, Prefect (4+ years experience)
- **APIs**: REST/GraphQL integration expertise
- **AI Tools**: GPT-4, RPA platforms, ML for pattern recognition
- **Data**: ETL/ELT pipelines, real-time processing
- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, scalable architectures

**Industry-Specific Knowledge (OTA Context):**
- Hospitality metrics (NetRevPAR, occupancy, ADR, booking velocity)
- OTA ecosystem dynamics (Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia)
- Market intelligence tools (AirDNA for benchmarking, Google Trends for demand)
- Competitive analysis and revenue optimization

- Automated key processes across multiple departments with measurable time savings
- Implemented AI solutions handling previously impossible workflows
- Established systematic automation prioritization framework
- Became the go-to automation expert organization-wide
- Created measurable company-wide productivity impact

**Core Philosophy:**
- **Identify → Automate → Measure → Improve** continuous cycle
- Every automation must reduce workload AND improve efficiency
- Complex problems require AI-powered decision-making, not just simple if/then
- Success = teams focusing on strategic work, not manual tasks
- Documentation and training ensure adoption and self-service

## Core Development Principles

1. **Do exactly what is asked** - nothing more, nothing less
2. **Preserve existing functionality** - this codebase is live in production
3. **Follow existing patterns** - study the codebase before implementing
4. **Never hard-code values** - implement general, scalable solutions
5. **Test thoroughly** - create temporary test files, clean up afterward
6. **Communicate before major changes** - especially database schema modifications
7. **No unnecessary files** - prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
8. **No proactive documentation** - only create docs when explicitly requested

## AI Assistant Instructions

When working with this codebase:

1. **Read first, write second** - Always examine existing code
2. **Test locally** - Never assume code works
3. **Ask when uncertain** - Production data is sacred
4. **Document assumptions** - Future devs need context
5. **Optimize for mobile** - It's the primary platform

## Project Overview

- **Company**: Kasa - Leading tech-enabled hotel and apartment hotel brand
- **Position**: AI Innovation Specialist (Remote, US-based)
- **Salary Range**: $100K-$115K base + equity + benefits
- **Timeline**: 5 days to complete take-home test (started: 2025-08-18)
- **Goal**: Design an automated OTA monitoring system that prevents revenue loss

## The Challenge: OTA Performance Monitoring

### Current Situation

- Kasa manages **hundreds of listings** across Airbnb, Expedia, and Booking.com
- Uses a **lean centralized team** for management
- Currently relies on **manual monitoring** and spreadsheets
- OTA-reported metrics reviewed manually: search rank, impressions, clicks, conversions, booking velocity
- **Critical issues go undetected**: listings down, missing fees/policies, poor conversion rates
- Teams waste time triaging preventable issues instead of strategic improvements

### Business Objective

- Improve **NetRevPAR** (Net Revenue Per Available Room) - focus on profitability, not just bookings
- Minimize preventable revenue loss from broken listings
- Ensure high-ROI visibility across all OTAs
- Reduce manual QA overhead

## Deliverables Required

### 1. Memo

- Methodology overview and key assumptions
- The Why: Tool selection rationale
- The How: Alert surfacing recommendations
- Error handling approach
- The "And Then What": Action item translation for teams
- Follow-up questions and next steps

### 2. Working Automation

- Proof of concept using Zapier, n8n, or custom scripts
- Must execute part of the pipeline

### 3. Automation Architecture Diagram

- Visual layout of end-to-end workflow
- Tools, data flow, and dependencies

### 4. Sample Alert Logic

- Scoring logic or anomaly detection approach
- How to flag underperforming listings

## What Makes This "AI-Powered" vs Basic Automation

### Basic Automation (Not What They Want)

- Simple scheduled checks (CRON jobs)
- Binary alerts (listing is up/down)
- Static thresholds (alert if views < 50)

### AI-Powered Automation (What They Want)

- **Pattern Recognition**: "This listing's Tuesday bookings are 40% below similar properties"
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: "Focus on this issue - it's costing $500/day based on historical patterns"
- **Predictive Alerts**: "This listing shows early signs of the same issue that caused revenue drop last month"
- **Context-Aware Decisions**: "Miami beach properties should get 50 views/day in December, but this one has 10"
- **Root Cause Analysis**: "Last 3 times we saw this pattern, it was missing pet fees"
