## ETL Explanation for Memo
ETL = Extract, Transform, Load - the process of moving data between systems:
- **Extract**: Pull data from OTA APIs (Airbnb, Booking.com metrics)
- **Transform**: Calculate anomalies, format alerts, add context
- **Load**: Send to Slack, store for historical analysis

Your werkflow project used ETL concepts:
- Extract: API calls to fetch data
- Transform: Processing/formatting the data
- Load: Sending to destination systems

This is standard data pipeline terminology that shows you understand data flow architecture.
