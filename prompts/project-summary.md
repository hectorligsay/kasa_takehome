# Kasa OTA Monitoring Project - Quick Reference

## 🎯 Mission
Build an AI-powered monitoring system that automatically detects underperforming OTA listings and prevents revenue loss through intelligent alerts.

## 📋 Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] **Memo**: Methodology, assumptions, recommendations (~2 pages)
- [ ] **Working Automation**: n8n proof of concept 
- [ ] **Architecture Diagram**: Visual workflow representation
- [ ] **Alert Logic**: Scoring algorithm demonstration

## 🔑 Key Differentiators
1. **AI-Powered**: Pattern recognition, not just threshold alerts
2. **Revenue-Focused**: Every alert tied to $ impact
3. **Actionable**: Tells teams exactly what to do
4. **Scalable**: Works for 10 or 10,000 properties

## 🛠 Tech Stack (POC)
- **Orchestration**: n8n (cloud version for POC)
- **Intelligence**: Python + scikit-learn
- **Alerts**: Slack API
- **Data**: PostgreSQL (Supabase free tier)

## 📊 Core Metrics to Monitor
1. **Conversion Rate**: Page views → Bookings
2. **Search Visibility**: Impressions & ranking
3. **Revenue Metrics**: ADR, occupancy, RevPAR
4. **Operational Health**: Response rate, availability

## 🚨 Alert Priority Matrix
- **Critical**: >$500/day impact, immediate action
- **High**: $100-500/day, same-day response  
- **Medium**: $50-100/day, 48-hour window
- **Low**: <$50/day, weekly review

## 📈 ROI Demonstration
- **Manual monitoring**: 2 hours/day × $50/hour = $100/day cost
- **Revenue recovery**: $50K/month in prevented losses
- **Detection speed**: Days → Minutes
- **Team efficiency**: 80% reduction in manual work

## 🎬 Demo Scenarios
1. **Sudden Conversion Drop**: Missing pricing → $850/day loss
2. **Gradual Degradation**: Competitor undercut → $300/day opportunity
3. **False Positive Prevention**: Learns weekly patterns

## 💡 Implementation Philosophy
- Start simple (1 metric, 10 properties)
- Prove value quickly (show $ saved)
- Scale intelligently (add complexity gradually)
- Maintain trust (low false positive rate)

## 📝 Memo Outline
1. **Executive Summary** (business impact focus)
2. **Current State** (manual process pain points)
3. **Proposed Solution** (AI-powered automation)
4. **Technical Approach** (n8n + intelligence layer)
5. **Success Metrics** (ROI, accuracy, efficiency)
6. **Implementation Plan** (phased rollout)
7. **Next Steps** (pilot program proposal)

## 🏃‍♂️ Next Actions (After Documentation)
1. Set up n8n cloud account
2. Create mock data generator
3. Build first anomaly detection workflow
4. Design Slack alert format
5. Create architecture diagram
6. Record demo video
7. Write final memo
8. Package and submit

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- Detects 90% of real issues
- <10% false positive rate
- Clear ROI demonstration
- Scalable architecture
- Happy stakeholders

## 📞 Interview Talking Points
- Removed manual work at Spectrum with calculator
- Built AI systems that reduce operational overhead
- Understand difference between automation and AI
- Focus on business outcomes, not just technology
- Experience with production systems

## ⚡ Quick Wins to Highlight
1. **Immediate Impact**: Start saving money day 1
2. **Easy Adoption**: Fits into existing Slack workflow
3. **Low Risk**: Can start with subset of properties
4. **High Visibility**: Executives see ROI clearly

## 🚀 Vision Statement
"Transform Kasa's OTA operations from reactive firefighting to proactive optimization, ensuring every property performs at its peak potential while freeing teams to focus on strategic growth."
