## Key Innovation: 3-Stage Analysis Framework

### Stage 1: First Impressions (What Gets Clicks)
- Hero image appeal via GPT-4 Vision
- Title optimization analysis
- Price positioning vs competitors

### Stage 2: Conversion Factors (What Drives Bookings)  
- Description effectiveness scoring
- Review sentiment analysis
- Amenity competitiveness

### Stage 3: Performance Benchmarking (Backend Metrics)
- Occupancy vs market average (AirDNA)
- Booking velocity comparison
- Calendar optimization

## Alert Intelligence (Not Just Thresholds)
- **Old Way**: "Impressions dropped 70%"
- **Our Way**: "You rank #15 of 20 similar properties because photo appeal is 4/10 vs 7/10 average"
- **Action**: "Update hero image like competitor VRBO #48573, expect +15% CTR"

## Core Principles
1. **Competitive context over absolute metrics** - 50% occupancy might be good if market is 40%
2. **Root cause analysis** - Don't just detect, explain WHY
3. **Actionable intelligence** - Every alert includes specific fixes with ROI
4. **Market-relative performance** - Benchmark against true competitors
5. **AI for qualitative assessment** - Let GPT-4 judge photo appeal

## Success Metrics
- Detection time: 48hr → 30min (99% improvement)
- Competitive positioning: Know exact rank vs similar properties
- Revenue opportunity: Calculate $ impact of closing gaps
- Team efficiency: 400 hours/month saved
